    "As well as initial conditions, SWIFT also requires a parameter file in `yaml` format. This file tells SWIFT what values it should use for certain internal constants, controls a myriad of physical mechanisms and how they should behave, and tells SWIFT where to find the inputs it needs and where it should put the outputs. You can find example parameter files in the `params` directory, which are mostly set up for these simulations. However, we will need to modify some parts of the parameter file for what we have created in the [previous section](Initial_Conditions.ipynb). \n",

There are a **lot** of moving parts!\n",

    "The main parameter we will have to change is the gravitational softening length, since it is a function of the particle resolution. Firstly, I'll give some quick background on what this is. When we run a simulation, we are using \"mass elements\" to represent the true matter distribution. The particles created in the previous step are merely a representation of the mass that makes up the halos, not the true mass elements on the halo. This \"quantisation\" into elements of the matter field imposes a spatial resolution below which forces are incorrect. To combat this, we \"soften\" the forces by adding a softening length ($\\epsilon$) into Newtons law,\n",

We can calculate the mean particle separation based on the density of matter in the Universe, the boxsize of the simulation and the particle mass. Recall the values for `boxsize`, `npart1`, and `npart2` from the halo merge you just made and input them below."

This defines the maximum physical softening length. As redshift decreases, the softening length will increase in size $\\propto (1+z)^{-1}$, hence the necessity of setting a maximal value. We can calculate this maximum by evaluating the physical softening length at some pivot redshift. $z=2.7$ is often used for this pivot. `max_physical_DM_softening` is therefore..."

If you want a more verbose output to see what SWIFT reports while it's running you can add `-v 1` to enable verbose outputs. For instance, when I ran this simulation I ran the following.\n",
