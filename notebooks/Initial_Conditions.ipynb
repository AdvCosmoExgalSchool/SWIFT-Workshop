    "Gas dominates the baryons in the Universe. We can treat this gas behaves as a fluid. Various simulations treat fluids in different ways with a myriad of different ways to solve hydrodynamics equations to describe the motion of fluids. SWIFT is a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. This means it uses particles smoothed over a kernel to represent the fluid and solves the hydrodynamical equation of motions using these kernels. The second property we are going to need for our gas is the smoothing length. This property describes the size of the kernel (or fluid element) the particle describes. In high-density environments the smoothing length is smaller, in low-density environments it is larger. In reality, the smoothing length of an SPH particle is defined based on its neighbouring SPH particles, SWIFT will recalculate smoothing lengths after reading in the initial conditions if we tell it to, and `swiftsimio` can be made to calculate initial guesses using `ics.gas.generate_smoothing_lengths`.\n",
