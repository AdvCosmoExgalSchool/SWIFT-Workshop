    "# Hydrodynamical Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have ICs with baryons, we need to compile a new version of SWIFT with the hydrodynamics turned on (NOTE: you can run a DMO simulation like before with a version of SWIFT configured for hydrodynamics but the reverse is not true). \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will need to reconfigure SWIFT with some extra configuration flags:\n",
    "```\n",
    "./configure --disable-mpi --disable-compiler-warnings --disable-doxygen-doc --disable-hand-vec --with-hydro=sphenix --with-kernel=wendland-C2\n",
    "```\n",
    "(here I've again included the Mac caveat options but you may not need to). There are a fair few different hydrodynamics schemes and kernels in SWIFT, here we are using the default choice of SPHENIX ([Borrow+22](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2367B/abstract)) combined with the $C2$ Wendlend kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now invoke `make` again and you'll have a new `swift` executable capable of handling hydrodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Parameter File\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to use the example parameter file `params/hydro_merger.yml`. This file contains a new `SPH` (short for Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) block with all the parameters controlling hydrodynamical calculations take a look but you do not need to modify these (or should not need to). We will again have to modify the softenings for our set-up though. Since we changed the mass of the dark matter particles their softening will also have changed. Let's recalculate the softenings and add them to the parameter file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've got this far, so I can point out that you can get SWIFT to generate gas much more robustly than we did by invoking `Initial_Conditions:generate_gas_in_ics: 1` in the parameter file, provided you are running with cosmology turned on (which we will do next). Had we used that I wouldn't have had an excuse to get you to muck around making baryons..."

You will once again find the resultant movie in the `videos` directory."
